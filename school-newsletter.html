                    Eleventh-graders Akhadzhon and Parviz have not yet graduated from school, but they are already actively 
                    mastering the basics of their future profession. One teaches English to adult students, the other works in a foreign 
                    logistics company. Knowledge of English helped classmates from comprehensive school No. 35 in Samarkand start earning money. 
                    The first to get a job was Parviz Khaidarov, who communicates freely with native English speakers. In September last year,
                    I was hired by a logistics company that directly cooperates with the USA, - says Parviz Khaidarov. - The first couple of months 
                    I worked as a student, but today - as a full-fledged employee. I work mainly in the evenings, without interrupting my studies. 
                    I answer calls, during which I regulate the transportation of goods, bargain with brokers. I communicate exclusively in English. To be honest, 
                    thanks to my work, I have improved my knowledge of spoken English quite well.

                    For students of our school, you, dear parents, will be able to purchase a uniform in stores that will be open near the Dynamo stadium by the end of July. They will sell the uniform that we will require specifically in our educational institution. Therefore, 
                    do not rush to purchase a uniform in other places! Exact information about the opening of these stores will be communicated in the school information channels
